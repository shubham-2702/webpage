<h1 class="one">VERSION CONTROL<h1>
<br>
<p class="one">Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. Using it, the developers can work together on code and separate their tasks through branches.Multiple people can work simultaneously on a single project. Everyone works on and edits their own copy of the files and it is up to them when they wish to share the changes made by them with the rest of the team.</p>
<br>
<p class="one">Version control provides access to the historical versions of a project. This is insurance against computer crashes or data loss. If any mistake is made, you can easily roll back to a previous version. It is also possible to undo specific edits that too without losing the work done in the meanwhile. It can be easily known when, why, and by whom any part of a file was edited.</p>

<br>
<li><b>Clone</b></li>
